# tictac3

This example is to demonstrate a basic EOSIO smart contract, including

- Define contract actions
    - create
    - close
    - move
- Define a table
    - games_table, a multi_index table on the eosio-blockchain, how to remove the existing table?
    -
- Perform read/write/remove operations on the table
    - emplace
    - modify 
    - the lamda function does the key work for inserting and modifying.
